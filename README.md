I'm Priyanka, a passionate Data Analyst with a knack for uncovering insights from complex datasets and turning them into compelling stories. With a background in MBA with a majoring in business analyst, I specialize in using tools like Python, R, SQL, and Tableau to drive data-driven decisions.

Currently, I am working with Spotify data to find out the most popular tracks and artists in my hackathon. My MBA course and related projects have helped me develop my communication, analytical, and problem-solving skills. I enrolled in the TripleTen 6-month Business Analyst program, which covers in-depth data visualization tools and techniques, SQL, and more, along with many practical projects. You can learn more about my projects in my repositories.

Some facts about me:
- ✈️ I enjoy visiting new places.
- 💃 🎤 I love singing and dancing—it's how I express myself outside of work.
- 🍔 I love to try different kinds of cuisine.
- 🎯 My goal for 2024: Landing my dream job.
